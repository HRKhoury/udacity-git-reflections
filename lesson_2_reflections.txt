What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	git init creates a .git directory (empty git repository)
	this will hold the metadata git uses to track commits/history

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	staging area just holds files before commitment
	allows files to be reviewed/changed before commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	
	git status (to view what's in the staging area)
	git diff   (to compare working directory to staging area)
	git diff --staged (to compare staging area to most recent commit)
