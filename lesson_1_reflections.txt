How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff compared the files quicker than human can
	diff marked the changes for easy spotting

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    quicker to use history to find/correct errors
	better starting point for future projects

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros - only save the version you want; save space
	cons - may lose intermediate changes; might forget to save 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    some code needs multi files, so multiple files might change to make one program change

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log 		lists the versions with the change note
	git diff 		compares files
	git log --stat 	shows how many insertions and deletions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    easy to revert to old (working) version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    learning java
	next udacity course
